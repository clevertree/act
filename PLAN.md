# act Improvement Plan

## Tasks
- [x] **Asynchronous Rendering**: Implement a scheduler using `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` to prevent main-thread blocking.
- [x] **State Batching**: Implement a mechanism to batch multiple `setState` calls into a single render cycle.
- [ ] **Modernization**: Convert codebase to ES6+ and use `hook-transpiler` or Babel for targeting older engines.

## Status
- **Asynchronous Rendering**: Completed
- **State Batching**: Completed
- **Modernization**: Not Started
